The repository contains all files necessary to process the EEG data accorning to Hilger & Euler (in prep.). Analyses were done in Matlab (.mat files) with ERPlab. The repository also includes the .BDF file, which is neccessary to run the scripts and files to create matrices for surface Laplacian transform. The amplitude and latency data for all participants at the electrodes of interest is listed in “vMMN_DV.1.28.20.xlsx”. The remaining files comprise the grand-averaged data and  files necessary to reproduce Figures of Hilger & Euler (in prep.).
